# nes-snake

An ugly [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game
for the NES/Famicom.  My first (and hopefully not the last) NES game.

## Usage

Just grab the `snake.nes` file and play it on any NES emulator, like
[FCEUX](http://fceux.com/).

## Development

This game is currently written for the
[asm6](http://3dscapture.com/NES/asm6.zip) assembler.  Just make sure you have
it on your PATH.

Run `make snake.nes` to assemble. If you run `make run`, it will play the rom
using `fceux`.  `make` will assemble and run the game.
